# Messenger notification on website change

This is not the original source code (with contains credentials and private website url).  
But it is a standalone working Python script.

Running on Linux with this crontab:

```
* * * * * cd /home/messenger/live/; ./main.py website.com/subfolder/file.php
```

NB0: I am not responsible for ban issues with your Messenger account, if it is not lightly used.

NB1: This code is not optimized and clean, I know but it is not completely finished.
